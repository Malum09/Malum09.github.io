        <h1>This is for you!</h1>
        <h2>I couldnt find motivation to really make my first project so i figured why not do it for me but instead for you</h2>
        <h3>Why i made this</h3>
        
        <p>I started to work on this because im struggling a lot right now in alot of ways and i know you understand but sometimes i feel like i do a terrible job at expressing how i feel a lot, especially in the moment i choke on my words as i try to convey my thoughts. Maybe as i take my time to write out the code on this website and you read what i said i hope you can understand a little better than what i tell you. </p>
        <p>I love you a lot and i hope i do a good job letting you know that, you have been nothing but an absolute treasure in my life you have helped me along everystep to where i am now mentally even taken the first step to getting some help. You have helped me stop my abundant drinking and other unhealthy choices in life and i think about that every day.</p>
        <p>i know this isnt a lot right now but i plan on building on this and adding to it when i get free time maybe build a little window into my mind who knows.</p>
